## Installation

First of all, create the virtual environment using ``virtualenv``. If you don't have ``virtualenv`` install first run,

```bash
  pip install virtualenv
```
Then create your virtual environment,
```bash
  virtualenv venv
```
Now activate your virtual environment,
```bash
  windows > venv\Scripts\activate
  linux > source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Once you are ready with your virtual environment, install all the required dependencies,
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the application,
```bash
  python ./app.py
```
Now your application is ready to interact!
